Just a random project. Don't expect much. I'm a terrible programmer.

everything should be able to compile with cargo + trunk. (idk which dependencies) Ollama is used for the LLM calls. nomic-embed-text for embedding. llama3.1:latest for other stuff.

needs serious rework if you want to use it in production
